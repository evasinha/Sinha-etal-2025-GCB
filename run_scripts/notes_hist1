For the GSWP3 compsets, it will run 70 years (through 1920-01-01) using the 1901-1920 forcing. When that is finsihed, you will need to go to the case_scripts directory and make the following changes:
 
./xmlchange DATM_CLMNCEP_YR_START=1920
./xmlchange DATM_CLMNCEP_YR_END=1980
./xmlchange CONTINUE_RUN=TRUE
./xmlchange STOP_N=60
./xmlchange DATM_CLMNCEP_YR_ALIGN=1920

Then you area ready to submit, from this directory:
./case.submit
